## Project Name: Data Science Specialization Course 3 Project

This is the project for the coursera Course 3: Getting and Tidying Data. 

The data used in this project was collected using the following URL
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
from the UCI Center for Machine Learning Systems.

Extract the zip file in a folder that will become your working directory for the run_analysis.R file to run properly.

The project includes the following files:
* **Readme.md** : This is the Readme File you are using
* **run_analysis.R** : The script to process and summarize the Data from the URL above, giving a final dataset as output. The dataset gives the average of the Activities and Subjects information
* **tidyDataSet.txt** : Final output of the R Script above

The original data for this project is a series of experiments that have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 

Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, data captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
